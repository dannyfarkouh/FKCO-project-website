                <h1>Who is Shihan Camille Ohan?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                Born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1949, Camille Ohan developed a strong foundation in discipline and respect from an early age.
                At just nine years old, he joined the Wadi El Nil Scouts, where weekends were dedicated to structured activities, fostering teamwork, resilience, and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond his love for running, cycling, soccer, volleyball, reading, and music, Camille was drawn to the art of combat. 
                To nurture this passion in a safe and disciplined environment, his parents enrolled him in karate. 
                His training took place primarily outdoors, where the natural world became his dojo. 
                The sounds of birds, wind, and flowing water heightened his concentration and deepened his understanding of breath controlâ€”an essential element of martial arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1967, Camille Ohan immigrated to Canada, where he pursued and successfully earned his bachelor's degree.
